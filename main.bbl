    {In recent years, we have witnessed a growing adoption of serious games in
  telerehabilitation by taking advantage of advanced multimedia technologies
  such as motion capture and virtual reality devices. Current serious game
  solutions for telerehabilitation suffer form lack of personalization and
  adaptiveness to patients’ needs and performance. This paper introduces
  “RehaBot”, a framework for adaptive generation of personalized serious
  games in the context of remote rehabilitation, using 3D motion tracking and
  virtual reality environments. A personalized and versatile gaming platform
  with embedded virtual assistants, called “Rehab bots”, is created.
  Utilizing these rehab bots, all workout session scenes will include a guide
  with various sets of motions to direct patients towards performing the
  prescribed exercises correctly. Furthermore, the rehab bots employ a robust
  technique to adjust the workout difficulty level in real-time to match the
  patients’ performance. This technique correlates and matches the patterns
  of the precalculated motions with patients’ motions to produce a highly
  engaging gamified workout experience. Moreover, multimodal insights are
  passed to the users pointing out the joints that did not perform as
  anticipated along with suggestions to improve the current performance. A
  clinical study was conducted on patients dealing with chronic neck pain to
  prove the usability and effectiveness of our adjunctive online physiotherapy
  solution. Ten participants used the serious gaming platform, while four
  participants performed the traditional procedure with an active program for
  neck pain relief, for two weeks (10 min, 10 sessions/2 weeks). Feasibility
  and user experience measures were collected, and the results of experiments
  show that patients found our game-based adaptive solution engaging and
  effective, and most of them could achieve high accuracy in performing the
  personalized prescribed therapies.}%

    Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have
  revolutionized learning approaches through immersive digital experience,
  interactive environment, simulation and engagement. Yet, these technologies
  are in developing stage and require massive investment and mass customization
  to meet the high demand in education. This comprehensive review aims to frame
  AR and VR development in education during the last twelve years. By adopting
  text mining and topic analysis approaches, a total of 1536 articles were
  selected for further analysis. These articles were selected from Scopus
  database based on specific criteria where titles, keywords and abstracts were
  extracted for analysis by WordStat. Hypotheses were formulated based on the
  prior works of AR and VR in education and being processed and evaluated to
  unvield state of art of AR and VR literature development, applications,
  advantages and future directions. Results reveal that adoption of AR and VR
  in education have exponential growth during recent years where wearable
  device have gain the large portion of this development. Based on secondary
  data, results also reveal the gap in implementing and customizing these
  technologies quickly in educational institutions. As AR and VR technologies
  rapidly develop and become mature, more educational applications emerge in
  learning process. Researchers are recommended to keep in pace to discover
  gaps of AR and VR transition to education and create effective adaptability
  approaches to gain more benefits of these technologies development.%

    YouMove is a novel system that allows users to record and learn physical
  movement sequences. The recording system is designed to be simple, allowing
  anyone to create and share training content. The training system uses
  recorded data to train the user using a large-scale augmented reality mirror.
  The system trains the user through a series of stages that gradually reduce
  the user's reliance on guidance and feedback. This paper discusses the design
  and implementation of YouMove and its interactive mirror. We also present a
  user study in which YouMove was shown to improve learning and short-term
  retention by a factor of 2 compared to a traditional video demonstration.%

    {Background: An aging population and people’s higher survival to diseases
  and traumas that leave physical consequences are challenging aspects in the
  context of an efficient health management. This is why telerehabilitation
  systems are being developed, to allow monitoring and support of physiotherapy
  sessions at home, which could reduce healthcare costs while also improving
  the quality of life of the users. Objectives: Our goal is the development of
  a Kinect-based algorithm that provides a very accurate real-time monitoring
  of physical rehabilitation exercises and that also provides a friendly
  interface oriented both to users and physiotherapists. Methods: The two main
  constituents of our algorithm are the posture classification method and the
  exercises recognition method. The exercises consist of series of movements.
  Each movement is composed of an initial posture, a final posture and the
  angular trajectories of the limbs involved in the movement. The algorithm was
  designed and tested with datasets of real movements performed by volunteers.
  We also explain in the paper how we obtained the optimal values for the
  trade-off values for posture and trajectory recognition. Results: Two
  relevant aspects of the algorithm were evaluated in our tests, classification
  accuracy and real-time data processing. We achieved 91.9\% accuracy in
  posture classification and 93.75\% accuracy in trajectory recognition. We
  also checked whether the algorithm was able to process the data in real-time.
  We found that our algorithm could process more than 20,000 postures per
  second and all the required trajectory data-series in real-time, which in
  practice guarantees no perceptible delays. Later on, we carried out two
  clinical trials with real patients that suffered shoulder disorders. We
  obtained an exercise monitoring accuracy of 95.16\%. Conclusions: We present
  an exercise recognition algorithm that handles the data provided by Kinect
  efficiently. The algorithm has been validated in a real scenario where we
  have verified its suitability. Moreover, we have received a positive feedback
  from both users and the physiotherapists who took part in the tests.}%

    {During the last decade, motion capture data has emerged and gained a
  leading role in animations, games and 3D environments. Many of these
  applications require the creation of expressive overview video clips
  capturing the human motion, however sufficient attention has not been given
  to this problem. In this paper, we present a technique that generates an
  overview video based on the analysis of motion capture data. Our method is
  targeted for applications of 3D character based animations, automating, for
  example, the action summary and gameplay overview in simulations and computer
  games. We base our method on quantum annealing optimization with an objective
  function that respects the analysis of the character motion and the camera
  movement constraints. It automatically generates a smooth camera control
  path, splitting it to several shots if required. To evaluate our method, we
  introduce a novel camera placement metric which is evaluated against previous
  work and conduct a user study comparing our results with the various
  systems.}%

    {Background: Systematic literature studies are commonly used in software
  engineering. There are two main ways of conducting the searches for these
  type of studies; they are snowballing and database searches. In snowballing,
  the reference list (backward snowballing - BSB) and citations (forward
  snowballing - FSB) of relevant papers are reviewed to identify new papers
  whereas in a database search, different databases are searched using
  predefined search strings to identify new papers. Objective: Snowballing has
  not been in use as extensively as database search. Hence it is important to
  evaluate its efficiency and reliability when being used as a search strategy
  in literature studies. Moreover, it is important to compare it to database
  searches. Method: In this paper, we applied snowballing in a literature
  study, and reflected on the outcome. We also compared database search with
  backward and forward snowballing. Database search and snowballing were
  conducted independently by different researchers. The searches of our
  literature study were compared with respect to the efficiency and reliability
  of the findings. Results: Out of the total number of papers found,
  snowballing identified 83\% of the papers in comparison to 46\% of the papers
  for the database search. Snowballing failed to identify a few relevant
  papers, which potentially could have been addressed by identifying a more
  comprehensive start set. Conclusion: The efficiency of snowballing is
  comparable to database search. It can potentially be more reliable than a
  database search however, the reliability is highly dependent on the creation
  of a suitable start set.}%

    {In a ballet studio, the teacher plays an important role in the process of
  learning positions and movements. However, there are occasions where the
  student needs to practice while the teacher is unavailable. In this
  situation, the student has no orientation and is likely to create bad habits
  during training, which may lead to worse results than before. In this work,
  we present the BalletVR, a Virtual Reality Kinect-based application for

    {Children with cerebral palsy (CP) often show impaired selective motor
  control (SMC) that induces limitations in motor function. Children with CP
  can improve aspects of pathological gait in an immediate response to visual
  biofeedback. It is not known, however, how these gait adaptations are
  achieved at the neural level, nor do we know the extent of SMC plasticity in
  CP. Investigate the underlying SMC and changes that may occur when gait is
  adapted with biofeedback. Twenty-three ambulatory children with CP and
  related (hereditary) forms of spastic paresis (Aged: 10.4 ± 3.1, 6–16
  years, M: 16/F: 9) were challenged with real-time biofeedback to improve step
  length, knee extension, and ankle power while walking on an instrumented
  treadmill in a virtual reality environment. The electromyograms of eight
  superficial muscles of the leg were analyzed and synergies were further
  decomposed using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) using 1 to 5
  synergies, to quantify SMC. Total variance accounted for (tVAF) was used as a
  measure of synergy complexity. An imposed four synergy solution was
  investigated further to compare similarity in weightings and timing patterns
  of matched paired synergies between baseline and biofeedback trials. Despite
  changes in walking pattern, changes in synergies were limited. The number of
  synergies required to explain at least 90\% of muscle activation increased
  significantly, however, the change in measures of tVAF1 from baseline (0.75
  ± 0.08) were less than ±2\% between trials. In addition, within-subject
  similarity of synergies to baseline walking was high (>0.8) across all
  biofeedback trials. These results suggest that while gait may be adapted in
  an immediate response, SMC as quantified by synergy analysis is perhaps more
  rigidly impaired in CP. Subtle changes in synergies were identified; however,
  it is questionable if these are clinically meaningful at the level of an
  individual. Adaptations may be limited in the short term, and further
  investigation is essential to establish if long term training using
  biofeedback leads to adapted SMC.}%

    {Background Virtual reality presents a platform for therapeutic gaming, and
  incorporation of immersive biofeedback on gait may enhance outcomes in
  rehabilitation. Time is limited in therapeutic practice, therefore any
  potential gait training tool requires a short set up time, while maintaining
  clinical relevance and accuracy. The aim of this study was to develop,
  validate, and establish the usability of an avatar-based application for
  biofeedback-enhanced gait training with minimal set up time. Methods A
  simplified, eight marker model was developed using eight passive markers
  placed on anatomical landmarks. This allowed for visualisation of
  avatar-based biofeedback on pelvis kinematics, hip and knee sagittal angles
  in real-time. Retrospective gait analysis data from typically developing
  children (n = 41) and children with cerebral palsy (n = 25), were
  used to validate eight marker model. Gait outcomes were compared to the Human
  Body Model using statistical parametric mapping. Usability for use in
  clinical practice was tested in five clinical rehabilitation centers with the
  system usability score. Findings Gait outcomes of Human Body Model and eight
  marker model were comparable, with small differences in gait parameters. The
  discrepancies between models were <5°, except for knee extension where eight
  marker model showed significantly less knee extension, especially towards
  full extension. The application was considered of ‘high marginal
  acceptability’ (system usability score, mean 68 (SD 13)). Interpretation
  Gait biofeedback can be achieved, to acceptable accuracy for within-session
  gait training, using an eight marker model. The application may be considered
  usable and implemented for use in patient populations undergoing gait
  training.}%

    {Digital biofeedback systems (DBSs) are used in physical rehabilitation to
  improve outcomes by engaging and educating patients and have the potential to
  support patients while doing targeted exercises during home rehabilitation.
  The components of feedback (mode, content, frequency and timing) can
  influence motor learning and engagement in various ways. The feedback design
  used in DBSs for targeted exercise home rehabilitation, as well as the
  evidence underpinning the feedback and how it is evaluated, is not clearly
  known. To explore these concepts, we conducted a scoping review where an
  electronic search of PUBMED, PEDro and ACM digital libraries was conducted
  from January 2000 to July 2019. The main inclusion criteria included DBSs for
  targeted exercises, in a home rehabilitation setting, which have been tested
  on a clinical population. Nineteen papers were reviewed, detailing thirteen
  different DBSs. Feedback was mainly visual, concurrent and descriptive,
  frequently providing knowledge of results. Three systems provided clear
  rationale for the use of feedback. Four studies conducted specific
  evaluations of the feedback, and seven studies evaluated feedback in a less
  detailed or indirect manner. Future studies should describe in detail the
  feedback design in DBSs and consider a robust evaluation of the feedback
  element of the intervention to determine its efficacy.}%

    {Machine tasks in workshops or factories are often a compound sequence of
  local, spatial, and body-coordinated human-machine interactions. Prior works
  have shown the merits of video-based and augmented reality (AR) tutoring
  systems for local tasks. However, due to the lack of a bodily representation
  of the tutor, they are not as effective for spatial and body-coordinated
  interactions. We propose avatars as an additional tutor representation to the
  existing AR instructions. In order to understand the design space of tutoring
  presence for machine tasks, we conduct a comparative study with 32 users. We
  aim to explore the strengths/limitations of the following four tutor options:
  video, non-avatar-AR, half-body+AR, and full-body+AR. The results show that
  users prefer the half-body+AR overall, especially for the spatial
  interactions. They have a preference for the full-body+AR for the
  body-coordinated interactions and the non-avatar-AR for the local
  interactions. We further discuss and summarize design recommendations and
  insights for future machine task tutoring systems.}%

    {Exergames have beneficial effects on the player's motivation to exercise.
  However, many current games lack accurate full-body motion recognition,
  resulting in players not performing the physical exercise the game requires.
  Therefore, we aim to develop an immersive virtual reality exergame that
  simultaneously recognizes and reconstructs full-body movements to motivate
  players to learn and practice yoga. The system analyzes the entire movement
  execution and identifies the player's execution errors to provide appropriate
  feedback so that players can then improve their movements. Such a system can
  be used in exergames designed for rehabilitation purposes to assist patients
  or to monitor their improvement. To access recognition performance, we
  trained and tested hidden Markov models and applied the leave-one-out
  cross-validation. The results show that the system achieves an F1-score of
  0.79 for yoga warrior I, 0.85 for yoga warrior II, and 0.66 for extended side
  angle. A user study with 32 participants revealed that the game was fun and
  that the players enjoyed it. Moreover, performance results show that players
  needed fewer attempts to correctly perform a pose as the exergame
  progressed.}%

    {We propose 2D stick figures as a unified medium for visualizing and
  searching for human motion data. The stick figures can express a wide range
  or human motion, and they are easy to be drawn by people without any
  professional training. In our interface, the user can browse overall motion
  by viewing the stick figure images generated from the database and retrieve
  them directly by using sketched stick figures as an input query. We started
  with a preliminary survey to observe how people draw stick figures. Based on
  the rules observed from the user study, we developed an algorithm converting
  motion data to a sequence of stick figures. The feature‐based comparison
  method between the stick figures provides an interactive and progressive
  search for the users. They assist the user's sketching by showing the current
  retrieval result at each stroke. We demonstrate the utility of the system
  with a user study, in which the participants retrieved example motion
  segments from the database with 102 motion files by using our interface.}%

    {We present a wireless virtual reality system and a prototype full body Tai
  Chi training application. Our primary contribution is the creation of a
  virtual reality system that tracks the full body in a working volume of 4
  meters by 5 meters by 2.3 meters high to produce an animated representation
  of the user with 42 degrees of freedom. This – combined with a lightweight
  (< 3 pounds) belt-worn video receiver and head-mounted display –provides a
  wide area, untethered virtual environment that allows exploration of new
  application areas. Our secondary contribution is our attempt to show that
  user interface techniques made possible by such a system can improve training
  for a full body motor task. We tested several immersive techniques, such as
  providing multiple copies of a teacher's body positioned around the student
  and allowing the student to superimpose his body directly over the virtual
  teacher. None of these techniques proved significantly better than mimicking
  traditional Tai Chi instruction, where we provided one virtual teacher
  directly in front of the student. We consider the implications of these
  findings for future motion training tasks.}%

    {Videos are a convenient platform to begin, maintain, or improve a fitness
  program or physical activity. Traditional video systems allow users to
  manipulate videos through specific user interface actions such as button
  clicks or mouse drags, but have no model of what the user is doing and are
  unable to adapt in useful ways. We present adaptive video playback, which
  seamlessly synchronises video playback with the user's movements, building
  upon the principle of direct manipulation video navigation. We implement
  adaptive video playback in Reactive Video, a vision-based system which
  supports users learning or practising a physical skill. The use of
  pre-existing videos removes the need to create bespoke content or specially
  authored videos, and the system can provide real-time guidance and feedback
  to better support users when learning new movements. Adaptive video playback
  using a discrete Bayes and particle filter are evaluated on a data set
  collected of participants performing tai chi and radio exercises. Results
  show that both approaches can accurately adapt to the user's movements,
  however reversing playback can be problematic.}%

    {In the past twenty years, there have been little to no advances in
  technology used for free weight exercises. However, with the advances of
  computer vision and the availability of technology such as the XBox Kinect,
  having computer assisted exercises are a definite possibility for gym
  experiences. In this paper we examine the possibility of using a real-time
  correcting tool for a user's form while performing a free weight exercise.
  The squat exercise was chosen because it is easily track-able due to its
  rigid and specific set of form specifications that allow it to be easily
  corrected. Through our pilot study we showed that a user could learn how to
  correctly perform an exercise and correct their form by using the feedback
  provided by our software.}%

  of joint movements, where bones are accurately rendered as a holographic
  overlay on the subject - like if the user has an “X-ray vision” - and in
  real-time as the subject performs the movement. Currently, hip and knee

  subjects. The data was collected using a web-based subjective experiment

  We provided a quantitative evaluation measure based on this ground truth

    {Over one billion people in the world live with some form of disability.
  This is incessantly increasing due to aging population and chronic diseases.
  Among the emerging social needs, rehabilitation services are the most
  required. However, they are scarce and expensive what considerably limits
  access to them. In this paper, we propose EVA, an augmented reality platform
  to engage and supervise rehabilitation sessions at home using low-cost
  sensors. It also stores the user’s statistics and allows therapists to
  tailor the exercise programs according to their performance. This system has
  been evaluated in both qualitative and quantitative ways obtaining very
  promising results.}%

    Computer graphics has evolved considerably over the past few decades. As
  computer science, digital arts, and other areas of study that use computer
  graphics continue to evolve and gain new substance, educators have come to
  master new content and achieve deeper understandings of computers and
  imagery. As the core field becomes more mature, educators in all computer
  graphics disciplines have a greater need for high-quality curricular
  resources. Offering excellent educational materials is an important service
  to the community of educators. Such support will empower both young and
  seasoned educators alike to benefit from and contribute to the work of
  others. In this way, we can achieve a higher standard of teaching
  worldwide.The purpose of our work is to provide tools to foster such a
  community of computer graphics educators. We will present a system that will
  act as the means for their work to be appraised, assessed and made available
  to others through an online server for refereed educational content in
  computer graphics.In this paper we describe the basis for and highlight some
  of the starting requirements of CGEMS, the online Computer Graphics
  Educational Materials Server. This is organized around a web-based groupware

    Computer Graphics (CG) as a discipline has undergone drastic modifications
  over the past decades. Indeed the phenomenal progress in both the technical
  and digital art domains requires educators to master new content and achieve
  deeper understandings of computers and imagery if they are to keep up with
  the pace of change. Moreover, as the core field matures, educators in all
  areas experience a greater need for high-quality curricular resources. Thus,
  offering excellent educational materials online is an important service to
  the community. Such support will empower both young and seasoned educators
  alike to benefit from and contribute to the work of others. The purpose of
  the work described here is to provide tools to foster such a community of CG
  educators. We present a system that will allow for original work to be
  appraised, assessed and made available to others through an online source for
  refereed educational content in CG. The present paper highlights some of the
  user requirements and describes the current status of CGEMS, the online CG
  Educational Materials Source. This is organized around a web-based groupware
  application that supports the all phases of submission, reviewing,

    {In contrast to varied therapy approaches, mirror therapy (MT) can be used
  even in completely plegic stroke survivors, as it uses visual stimuli for
  producing a desired response in the affected limb. MT has been studied to
  have effects not just on motor impairments but also on sensations,
  visuospatial neglect, and pain after stroke. This paper attempts to
  systematically review and present the current perspectives on mirror therapy
  and its application in stroke rehabilitation, and dosage, feasibility and
  acceptability in stroke rehabilitation. An electronic database search across
  Google, PubMed, Web of Science, etc., generated 3871 results. After screening
  them based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we included 28 studies in
  this review. The data collected were divided on the basis of application in
  stroke rehabilitation, modes of intervention delivery, and types of control
  and outcome assessment. We found that most studies intervened for upper limb
  motor impairments post stroke. Studies were equally distributed between
  intervention in chronic and acute phases post stroke with therapy durations
  lasting between 1 and 8 weeks. MT showed definitive motor and sensory
  improvements although the extent of improvements in sensory impairments and
  hemineglect is limited. MT proves to be an effective and feasible approach to
  rehabilitate post-stroke survivors in the acute, sub-acute, and chronic
  phases of stroke, although its long-term effects and impact on activities of
  daily living need to be analysed extensively.}%

    {Industrial Augmented Reality (iAR) has demonstrated its advantages to
  communicate technical information in the fields of maintenance, assembly, and
  training. However, literature is scattered among different visual assets
  (i.e., AR visual user interface elements associated with a real scene). In
  this work, we present a systematic literature review of visual assets used in
  these industrial fields. We searched five databases, initially finding 1757
  papers. Then, we selected 122 iAR papers from 1997 to 2019 and extracted 348
  visual assets. We propose a classification for visual assets according to (i)
  what is displayed, (ii) how it conveys information (frame of reference, color
  coding, animation), and, (iii) why it is used. Our review shows that product
  models, text and auxiliary models are, in order, the most common, with each
  most often used to support operating, checking and locating tasks
  respectively. Other visual assets are scarcely used. Product and auxiliary
  models are commonly rendered world-fixed, color coding is not used as often
  as expected, while animations are limited to product and auxiliary model.
  This survey provides a snapshot of over 20 years of literature in iAR, useful
  to understand established practices to orientate in iAR interface design and
  to present future research directions.}%

    {Understanding the correct self-posture is known to improve the performance
  of motor skills in sports, dance, ballet, walking, and running. However, it
  is difficult to understand the accurate self-posture and move one's body as
  intended for imitation or learning, especially in-situation. Based on
  previous physiological research, we herein propose the addition of a new
  assisting viewpoint to the human body interface for understanding the correct
  self-posture without interrupting the training process. This new viewpoint
  enables the users to see their current posture as a three-dimensional
  skeletal image that is an avatar which synchronizes with the owner's
  movements. The Optical See-Through Head Mounted Display (OST-HMD) and
  Full-Body Motion Capture (MoCap) are used for creating the proposed
  viewpoint. The position and the angle of view of an avatar is determined by
  the rotation of the user's head interactively. Moreover, visualizing the
  avatar's trail helps users to understand how to moved their own body
  correctly. We conducted several experiments to confirm the avatar system's
  validity and the availability for an expert athlete. Our results showed that
  the proposed viewpoint was successful in enabling the user to understand the
  accurate self-posture in-situation without occurring interruption.}%

    {In many activities, such as martial arts, physical exercise, and
  physiotherapy, the users are asked to perform a sequence of body movements
  with highly accurate arm positions. Sometimes, the movements are too
  complicated for users to learn, even by imitating the action of the coach
  directly. This paper presents a fully immersive augmented reality (AR)
  system, which provides egocentric hints to guide the arm movement of the user
  via a video see-through head-mounted display (HMD). By using this system, the
  user can perform the exactitude of arm movement simply by moving his arms to
  follow and match the virtual arms, rendered from coach's movement of
  database, in the first-person view. To ensure the rendered virtual arms
  correctly aligned with the user's real shoulders, a calibration method is
  proposed to estimate the length of the user's arms and the positions of his
  head and shoulders in advance. In addition, we apply the system to
  Tai-Chi-Chuan practicing, our preliminary study has shown that the proposed
  egocentric hints can provide intuitive guidance for users to follow the arm
  movement of the coach with exactitude.}%

    {Tai-Chi Chuan (TCC) is a famous physical exercise and well-known for being
  able to effectively promote physical well-being. Many people have been
  interested in learning TCC at the beginning, but eventually failed in
  mastering it due to the lack of a constantly accompanying master on the side.
  In this paper, we present an augmented-learning tool, called "My Tai-Chi
  Coaches", for learning TCC. By wearing an optical see-through Head-Mounted
  Display (HMD), the users can have their own private coaches-on-demand that
  will guide them in practicing TCC. To solve the "attention-sticking" problem,
  we propose the use of "redundant coaches" and high-lighting the primary coach
  at every instant. When the user wants to adjust his posture to mimic the
  coach's movement, he can simply suspend his motion, and then the drone will
  fly to a proper position to capture the images of the user's posture, and
  display them on an augmented mirror placed near by the highlighted or gazed
  coach. In addition to learning TCC, the proposed augmented-learning tool can
  also be used for learning dancing, yoga, sporting, and for rehabilitation.}%

    {Computer simulations are gaining interest from researchers and therapists
  involved in stroke rehabilitation because they offer a means to monitor user
  activity and replicate tasks within safe and controlled environments. We
  developed a virtual environment (VE) to simulate the potentially hazardous
  task of making a hot drink. A three dimensional representation of a kitchen,
  including objects and utensils, was displayed on a computer screen and
  controlled through a touch screen interface. We also developed a user
  interface that employed real, physical kitchen objects, adapted in order to
  provide the computer with spatial and orientation data through a combination
  of motion sensors and a computer vision system. This tactile interface
  technology is known as a tangible user interface (TUI) and together with a VE
  comprises a mixed reality (MR) system. The MR system described here enabled
  users to perform naturalistic upper limb movements in order to interact with
  the task simulation. In this chapter we explain how the VE and MR systems
  were developed through a user-centred design process that involved the
  participation of consultants, clinicians and stroke survivors. Case examples
  of feasibility and evaluation studies using both the VE and MR systems are
  presented and discussed. Recommendations for the design and development of MR
  systems specifically for stroke rehabilitation are included.}%

    {Feedback is essential for skill acquisition as it helps identifying and
  correcting performance errors. Nowadays, Virtual Reality can be used as a
  tool to guide motor learning, and to provide innovative types of augmented
  feedback that exceed real world opportunities. Concurrent feedback has shown
  to be especially beneficial for novices. Moreover, watching skilled
  performances helps novices to acquire a motor skill, and this effect depends
  on the perspective taken by the observer. To date, however, the impact of
  watching one's own performance together with full body superimposition of a
  skilled performance, either from the front or from the side, remains to be
  explored. Here we used an immersive, state-of-the-art, low-latency cave
  automatic virtual environment (CAVE), and we asked novices to perform squat
  movements in front of a virtual mirror. Participants were assigned to one of
  three concurrent visual feedback groups: participants either watched their
  own avatar performing full body movements or were presented with the movement
  of a skilled individual superimposed on their own performance during movement
  execution, either from a frontal or from a side view. Motor performance and
  cognitive representation were measured in order to track changes in movement
  quality as well as motor memory across time. Consistent with our hypotheses,
  results showed an advantage of the groups that observed their own avatar
  performing the squat together with the superimposed skilled performance for
  some of the investigated parameters, depending on perspective. Specifically,
  for the deepest point of the squat, participants watching the squat from the
  front adapted their height, while those watching from the side adapted their
  backward movement. In a control experiment, we ruled out the possibility that
  the observed improvements were due to the mere fact of performing the squat
  movements—irrespective of the type of visual feedback. The present findings
  indicate that it can be beneficial for novices to watch themselves together
  with a skilled performance during execution, and that improvement depends on
  the perspective chosen.}%

    {The current paper describes research that is aimed to elucidate our
  understanding of technology factors that may help users of home exercise
  equipment to stay motivated for doing regular work-outs. In particular, we
  investigated the effects of immersion and coaching by a virtual agent on
  intrinsic motivation and the sense of presence of participants cycling on a
  stationary home exercise bike. A basic two-by-two within-subjects
  experimental design was employed whereby participants were presented with a
  virtual racetrack with two levels of immersion (high vs. low) and two levels
  of a virtual coach (with vs. without). Results indicate a clear positive
  effect of immersion on both motivation and presence. The virtual coach
  significantly lowered the perceived control and pressure/tension dimensions
  of intrinsic motivation, but did not affect the enjoyment dimension. The
  presence of the virtual coach also reduced negative effects associated with
  VEs.}%

    {Consulting a physiotherapist or physical trainer for long term regular
  exercises is not financially affordable for all. As a solution, our long term
  research goal is to develop a robotic physiotherapist/physical trainer which
  could instructively and physically guide a performer. Towards that direction,
  in this paper we present an autonomously repositioning mobile robot to
  observe a person throughout a sequence of physical exercises by selecting
  less self-occluded viewpoints. A viewpoint specific joint mutual occlusion
  (JMO) measurement is formulated at candidate viewpoints. Then a utility
  function, which accounts for joint occlusion, skeleton coverage, sensing
  range and moving cost, is averaged over the sub-activity periodic duration to
  find the optimal viewpoint. Proposed methods have been evaluated with
  multi-view dataset and an online mobile robot while a person performed eight
  different physical activities with two trials each. Results indicate proposed
  active view planner can autonomously drive the mobile robot to a less
  self-occluded viewpoint over manually setup fixed viewpoint observation,
  leading to more accurate human movement analysis.}%

    {Gait retraining interventions using real-time biofeedback have been
  proposed to alter the loading across the knee joint in patients with knee
  osteoarthritis. Despite the demonstrated benefits of these conservative
  treatments, their clinical adoption is currently obstructed by the high
  complexity, spatial demands, and cost of optical motion capture systems. In
  this study we propose and evaluate a wearable visual feedback system for gait
  retraining of the foot progression angle (FPA). The primary components of the
  system are inertial measurement units, which track the human movement without
  spatial limitations, and an augmented reality headset used to project the
  visual feedback in the visual field. The adapted gait protocol contained five
  different target angles ranging from 15 degrees toe-out to 5 degrees toe-in.
  Eleven healthy participants walked on an instrumented treadmill, and the
  protocol was performed using both an established laboratory visual feedback
  driven by optical motion capture, and the proposed wearable system. The
  wearable system tracked FPA with an accuracy of 2.4 degrees RMS and ICC=0.94
  across all target angles and subjects, when compared to an optical motion
  capture reference. In addition, the effectiveness of the biofeedback,
  reflected by the number of steps with FPA value ±2 degrees from the target,
  was found to be around 50\% in both wearable and laboratory approaches. These
  findings demonstrate that retraining of the FPA using wearable inertial
  sensing and visual feedback is feasible with effectiveness matching closely
  an established laboratory method. The proposed wearable setup may reduce the
  complexity of gait retraining applications and facilitate their transfer to
  routine clinical practice.}%

    {The accuracy of monocular 3D human pose estimation depends on the
  viewpoint from which the image is captured. While freely moving cameras, such
  as on drones, provide control over this viewpoint, automatically positioning
  them at the location which will yield the highest accuracy remains an open
  problem. This is the problem that we address in this paper. Specifically,
  given a short video sequence, we introduce an algorithm that predicts which
  viewpoints should be chosen to capture future frames so as to maximize 3D
  human pose estimation accuracy. The key idea underlying our approach is a
  method to estimate the uncertainty of the 3D body pose estimates. We
  integrate several sources of uncertainty, originating from deep learning
  based regressors and temporal smoothness. Our motion planner yields improved
  3D body pose estimates and outperforms or matches existing ones that are
  based on person following and orbiting.}%

    {Modern people do not have much time to take care of their health due to

  The users' motions are sent to the server using Raspberry Pi. Once the server
  receives the video, it sends the correct movements back to the user. Upon
  receiving the correct movements, the feedback, which is provided from the
  Guide video, the user can compare their movements to it. The users can
  correct their motions by following the correct motions provided from the
  Guide video. The incorrect motion is determined by the gap of the angle of
  the user's joints from the Guide video. This proposed Smart mirror system is

    {Rock climbing involves complex movements and therefore requires guidance
  when acquiring a new technique. The classic approach is mimicking the
  movements of a more experienced climber. However, the trainee has to remember
  every nuance of the climb, since the sequence of movements cannot be
  performed in parallel to the experienced climber. As a solution to this
  problem, we present a video recording and replay system for climbing. The
  replay component allows for different in-situ video feedback methods. We
  investigated the video feedback component of the system by studying two
  example visualization techniques, i.e. a life-sized in-place projection and a
  real-time third-person view of the climber, augmented by a video showing a
  successful ascent. The latter is presented to the user on both Google Glass
  and a projected display. The results indicate that a life-sized projection
  was perceived as easiest to follow, while most of the climbers had problems
  with the context switches between the augmented video and the climbing wall.
  These findings can aid in the design of assistance systems that teach complex
  movements.}%

    {Answering the question “what is the most preferable view of a
  three-dimensional (3-D) human model?” is a challenge in computer vision,
  computer graphics, and cinematography applications because the appearance of
  a human, for a given pose, relies on the viewpoint of the user. Currently, to
  the best of the authors’ knowledge, solid research on the most preferable
  viewing angle for obtaining numerical subjective evaluation scores has not
  been conducted. In this study, we investigate a metric that can be used to
  quantify the view of a 3-D human model, whose value is maximized at the most
  favorable camera angle in accordance with subjective assessments done by
  users. For an objective assessment in a numerical form, in this study, we
  define three view selection metrics: the 1) normalized limb length sum; 2)
  normalized area of a two-dimensional bounding box; and 3) normalized visible
  area of a 3-D bounding box. Finally, we formulate a viewpoint optimization
  problem whose objective function is the sum of the metrics. However, the
  objective function is nonconcave, and the solution set of the constraint is
  nonconvex. To overcome this difficulty, we employ decomposition and penalty
  methods. From the simulation results, it is verified that the average of the
  viewpoint selection error between the ground truth viewpoint and the optimal
  viewpoint obtained by the proposed algorithm is very close to the lower bound
  of the viewpoint selection error.}%

    We learn and/or relearn motor skills at all ages. Feedback plays a crucial
  role in this learning process, and Virtual Reality (VR) constitutes a unique
  tool to provide feedback and improve motor learning. In particular, VR grants
  the possibility to edit 3D movements and display augmented feedback in real
  time. Here we combined VR and motion capture to provide learners with a 3D
  feedback superimposing in real time the reference movements of an expert
  (expert feedback) to the movements of the learner (self feedback). We
  assessed the effectiveness of this feedback for the learning of a throwing
  movement in American football. This feedback was used during (concurrent
  feedback) and/or after movement execution (delayed feedback), and it was
  compared with a feedback displaying only the reference movements of the
  expert. In contrast with more traditional studies relying on video feedback,
  we used the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm coupled to motion capture to
  measure the spatial characteristics of the movements. We also assessed the
  regularity with which the learner reproduced the reference movement along its
  path. For that, we used a new metric computing the dispersion of distance
  around the mean distance over time. Our results show that when the movements
  of the expert were superimposed on the movements of the learner during
  learning (i.e., self + expert), the reproduction of the reference movement
  improved significantly. Furthermore, providing feedback about the movements
  of the expert only did not give rise to any significant improvement regarding
  movement reproduction.%

    { Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarize evidence
  relating to efficacy and safety of health care interventions accurately and
  reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, is not
  optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to
  clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the
  QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement—a reporting
  guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual,
  methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of
  systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic
  reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly
  reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included
  experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting
  Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the
  original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
  evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA Statement consists of a
  27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items
  deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this
  Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale
  for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good
  reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and
  methodological literature. The PRISMA Statement, this document, and the
  associated Web site (http://www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful
  resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.}%

    How should we assess programming skills? Asking students to write code in a
  traditional hand-written exam can produce results like those in Figure 1. It
  is nearly impossible to meaningfully grade such code. With sufficient effort
  one can get some idea of whether the general idea is correct, but to assess
  programming skill we need much more than this. For example, there will almost
  certainly be errors in the code; how do we know whether the student would be
  able to correct those errors or not?%

    {This chapter discusses the applications and solutions of emerging Virtual
  Reality (VR) and video games technologies in the healthcare sector, e.g.
  physical therapy for motor rehabilitation, exposure therapy for psychological
  phobias, and pain relief. Section 2 reviews state-of-the-art interactive
  devices used in current VR systems and high-end games such as sensor-based
  and camera-based tracking devices, data gloves, and haptic force feedback
  devices. Section 3 investigates recent advances and key concepts in games
  technology, including dynamic simulation, flow theory, adaptive games, and
  their possible implementation in serious games for healthcare. Various
  serious games are described in this section: some were designed and developed
  for specific healthcare purposes, e.g. BreakAway (2009)â€™s Free Dive,
  HopeLab (2006)â€™s Re-Mission, and Ma et al. (2007)â€™s VR game
  series, others were utilising off-the-shelf games such as Nintendo Wii sports
  for physiotherapy. A couple of experiments of using VR systems and games for
  stroke rehabilitation are highlighted in section 4 as examples to showcase
  the benefits and impacts of these technologies to conventional clinic
  practice. Finally, section 5 points some future directions of applying
  emerging games technologies in healthcare, such as augmented reality,
  Wii-mote motion control system, and even full body motion capture and
  controller free games technology demonstrated recently on E3 2009 which have
  great potentials to treat motor disorders, combat obesity, and other
  healthcare applications.}%

    {Learning new motor skills is a problem that people are constantly
  confronted with (e.g. to learn a new kind of sport). In our work, we
  investigate to which extent the learning process of a motor sequence can be
  optimized with the help of Augmented Reality as a technical assistant.
  Therefore, we propose an approach that divides the problem into three tasks:
  (1) the tracking of the necessary movements, (2) the creation of a model that
  calculates possible deviations and (3) the implementation of a visual
  feedback system. To evaluate our approach, we implemented the idea by using
  infrared depth sensors and an Augmented Reality head-mounted device
  (HoloLens). Our results show that the system can give an efficient assistance
  for the correct height of a throw with one ball. Furthermore, it provides a
  basis for the support of a complete juggling sequence.}%

    {A video tutorial effectively conveys complex motions, but may be hard to
  follow precisely because of its restriction to a predetermined viewpoint.
  Augmented reality (AR) tutorials have been demonstrated to be more effective.
  We bring the advantages of both together by interactively retargeting
  conventional, two-dimensional videos into three-dimensional AR tutorials.
  Unlike previous work, we do not simply overlay video, but synthesize
  3D-registered motion from the video. Since the information in the resulting
  AR tutorial is registered to 3D objects, the user can freely change the
  viewpoint without degrading the experience. This approach applies to many
  styles of video tutorials. In this work, we concentrate on a class of
  tutorials which alter the surface of an object.}%

    {We report on findings from two focus groups for designing an application
  for balance training at home with an augmented reality virtual coach.
  Following a User-Centered Design approach, we performed two focus groups with
  older adults at the early stages of development. Focus group participants
  were shown a prototype using a Meta 2 head mounted display. Their movements
  were tracked using a Kinect 2. The virtual coach gave balance training
  instructions and demonstrated their correct performance. Results suggest
  that, given the trade-offs of traditional health care, older adults are
  positive towards using an AR coach for their balance training.}%

    {Aims and Objectives: Stroke is the main cause of long-term disabilit and
  happens mostly in the older population. Stroke affected patients experience
  either of the cognitive, visual or motor losses and recovery requires time
  and patience as they have to do physical exercises every day and at times
  repetitively. There are various types of stroke rehabilitation exercises
  focussing on technological solutions that include therapies performed using
  games. Motion-based games are popular in encouraging participants to perform
  repetitive tasks without being getting bored. Therefore, in this study, we
  have explored studies that included the use of games for stroke
  rehabilitation to understand the design principles and characteristics of the
  games used for these purposes. Method: A number of medical respositories were
  searched for relevant articles in a window of 2008-2018. 18 studies were
  chosen for the scoping review depending on the inclusion criteria, and design
  principles used in these studies are analysed and evaluated. Results and
  Conclusion: We present main findings from our review concerning the
  attributes of existing games for stroke rehabilitation such as meaningful
  play, handling of failures, emphasising challenge, and the value of feedback.
  We conclude with a list of design recommendations that future serious game
  developers can consider while designing interfaces for stroke patients.}%

    {In this demo, we present Slackliner 2.0, an interactive slackline training
  assistant which features head and skeleton tracking, and real-time feedback
  through life-size projection. Like in other sports, proper training leads to
  a faster increase of skill and lessens the risk of injuries. We chose a set
  of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer
  which guides the user through the exercises giving feedback if the exercises
  were executed correctly. Based on lessons learned from our study and prior
  demonstrations we present a revised version of Slackliner that uses head
  tracking to better guide the user's attention and movements. Additionally a
  new visual indicator informs the trainee about her arm posture during the
  performance. This has been also included in an updated post-analysis view
  that provides the trainee with more detailed feedback about her performance.
  The present demo showcases an interactive sports training system that
  provides in-situ feedback while following a well-guided learning procedure.}%

    {We learn and/or relearn motor skills at all ages. Feedback plays a crucial
  role in this learning process, and Virtual Reality (VR) constitutes a unique
  tool to provide feedback and improve motor learning. In particular, VR grants
  the possibility to edit 3D movements and display augmented feedback in real
  time. Here we combined VR and motion capture to provide learners with a 3D
  feedback superimposing in real time the reference movements of an expert
  (expert feedback) to the movements of the learner (self feedback). We
  assessed the effectiveness of this feedback for the learning of a throwing
  movement in American football. This feedback was used during (concurrent
  feedback) and/or after movement execution (delayed feedback), and it was
  compared with a feedback displaying only the reference movements of the
  expert. In contrast with more traditional studies relying on video feedback,
  we used the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm coupled to motion capture to
  measure the spatial characteristics of the movements. We also assessed the
  regularity with which the learner reproduced the reference movement along its
  path. For that, we used a new metric computing the dispersion of distance
  around the mean distance over time. Our results show that when the movements
  of the expert were superimposed on the movements of the learner during
  learning (i.e., self + expert), the reproduction of the reference movement
  improved significantly. Furthermore, providing feedback about the movements
  of the expert only did not give rise to any significant improvement regarding
  movement reproduction.}%

  aims, research designs, participant characteristics, sport types, VR
  technology, measures, and key findings. From the review, it was shown that
  interactive VR applications have enhanced a range of performance,
  physiological, and psychological outcomes. The specific effects have been
  influenced by factors related to the athlete and the VR system, which
  comprise athlete factors, VR environment factors, task factors, and the
  non-VR environment factors. Important variables include the presence of
  others in the virtual environment, competitiveness, task autonomy, immersion,
  attentional focus, and feedback. The majority of research has been conducted
  on endurance sports, such as running, cycling, and rowing, and more research
  is required to examine the use of interactive VR in skill-based sports.
  Additional directions for future research and reporting standards for
  researchers are suggested.}%

    {This paper describes a prototype self-training system for tennis forehand
  shots that allows trainees to practice their motion forms by themselves. Our
  system uses a motion capture device to record a trainee's motion, and
  visualizes the differences between the features of the trainee's motion and
  the correct motion as performed by an expert. This system enables trainees to
  understand the errors in their motion and how to reduce or eliminate them. In
  this study, we classified the motion features and corresponding visualization
  methods using one-dimensional spatial, rotational, and temporal features
  based on the key sporting poses. We also developed a statistical model for
  the motion features, allowing the system to assess and prioritize all
  features of a trainee's motion. This research focuses on the motion of a
  tennis forehand shot and evaluates our prototype through several user
  experiments.}%

    {This paper describes the user experience (UX) design for a
  smart-mirror-based personalized training system which aims to help people
  live a healthy life. A number of researchers and companies have developed
  fitness systems that use a virtual coach which shows the user with actions
  they should perform. However such systems can be difficult to accurately
  follow the virtual guide’s motions and there are also limitations in the
  feedback provided to inform users of their correct body posture. This is
  because most systems are designed for users to simply watch and follow a
  character’s motions (poses) from a third person perspective. In our smart
  mirror-based system, users are able to follow the exercise-postures of a
  virtual professional trainer shown in a first person viewpoint and receive
  coaching through a real-time motion correction. This is based on a predefined
  database of the trainer’s postures gained from motion-capture technology,
  and it is personalized to the user’s body 3D model acquired through an
  instant one-time scanning process. In this paper, we report on the UX design
  of our system, mainly focusing on understandable visualization, intuitive
  interaction, attractive information representation and easily acceptable user
  scenarios. Through a series of user studies, we analyze and discuss user
  friendliness, information comprehension, and user satisfaction as they relate
  to our design. In addition, we also assess the similarity and effectiveness
  of the proposed system compared to traditional personalized training (PT) at
  a gym. Based on the implications, we discuss future research directions for
  improving the user experience of the smart-mirror-based PT system.}%

    {Joint angles are commonly measured in physical rehabilitation to evaluate
  joint function. Evidences showed that wearable inertial sensors can
  accurately quantify human motion information, however, the most advanced and
  accurate methodologies require the execution of complex calibration movements
  which are unsuitable to inexpert users and inadequate for a home context.
  This way, four different joint angles estimation methods requiring no
  calibration movement were developed in order to track the main human body
  joint angles in real time. IMUs mounted in bracelets were used to restrict
  sensor positioning on the limbs. For six different exercises, the estimated
  absolute and relative joint angles were evaluated against the marker-based
  video tracking software Kinovea ground-truth. Correlation analysis between
  estimated and ground-truth joint angles indicated a very strong and
  statistically significant correlation. The average error in estimated joint
  angles is below 5 degrees for all four methods employed, which may be an
  acceptable result for the rehabilitation at home scenario.}%

    {In this report, we organize and reflect on recent advances and challenges
  in the field of sports data visualization. The exponentiallyâ€growing
  body of visualization research based on sports data is a prime indication of
  the importance and timeliness of this report. Sports data visualization
  research encompasses the breadth of visualization tasks and goals: exploring
  the design of new visualization techniques; adapting existing visualizations
  to a novel domain; and conducting design studies and evaluations in close
  collaboration with experts, including practitioners, enthusiasts, and
  journalists. Frequently this research has impact beyond sports in both
  academia and in industry because it is i) grounded in realistic, highly
  heterogeneous data, ii) applied to realâ€world problems, and iii)
  designed in close collaboration with domain experts. In this report, we
  analyze current research contributions through the lens of three categories
  of sports data: box score data (data containing statistical summaries of a
  sport event such as a game), tracking data (data about inâ€game actions
  and trajectories), and metaâ€data (data about the sport and its
  participants but not necessarily a given game). We conclude this report with
  a highâ€level discussion of sports visualization research informed by
  our analysisâ€”identifying critical research gaps and valuable
  opportunities for the visualization community. More information is available
  at the STAR's website: https://sportsdataviz.github.io/.}%

    {There are many possible 2D views of a given 3D object and most people
  would agree that some views are more aesthetic and/or more “informative”
  than others. Thus, it would be very useful, in many applications, to be able
  to automatically compute these “best” views. Although all measures of the
  quality of a view will ultimately be subjective, hence difficult to quantify,
  we propose some general principles which may be used to address this
  challenge. In particular, we describe a number of different ways to measure
  the goodness of a view, and show how to optimize these measures by reducing
  the size of the search space.}%

    {One challenge of supporting in-situ sketching tasks with Magic Lenses on
  handheld Augmented Reality systems is to provide accurate and robust pose
  tracking without disrupting the sketching experience. Typical tracking
  approaches rely on the back-facing camera both for tracking and providing the
  view of the physical scene. This typically requires a fiducial to be in the
  scene which can disrupt the sketching experience on a blank sheet of paper.
  We address this challenge by proposing a Dual Camera Magic Lens approach.
  Specifically, we use the front facing camera for tracking while the back
  camera concurrently provides the view of the scene. Preliminary evaluation on
  a virtual tracing task with an off-the-shelf handheld device suggests that
  the Dual Camera Magic Lens approach has the potential to be both faster and
  lead to a higher perceived satisfaction compared to Magic Lens and Static
  Peephole interfaces.}%

    {This paper provides a preliminary appraisal of combining commercial
  skeletal tracking and virtual reality technologies for the purposes of
  innovative gameplay interfaces in fall prevention exergames for the elderly.
  This work uses the previously published StepKinnection game, which used
  skeletal tracking with a flat screen monitor, as a primary point of
  comparison for the proposed combination of these interaction modalities.
  Here, a Microsoft Kinect is used to track the player's skeleton and represent
  it as an avatar in the virtual environment while the HTC Vive is used for
  head tracking and virtual reality visualization. Multiple avatar positioning
  modes are trialled and discussed via a small self-reflective study (with the
  authors as participants) to examine their ability to allow accurate stepping
  motions, maintain physical comfort, and encourage self-identification or
  empathy with the avatar. While this is just an initial study, it highlights
  promising opportunities for designing engaging step training games with this
  integrated interface but also highlights its limitations, especially in the
  context of an unsupervised exercise program of older people in independent
  living situations.}%

    We introduce a coding framework that supplements introductory computer

  effectively and lowering the excessive barrier of entry to 3D graphics
  programming. In particular, our framework provides tiny-graphics.js, a new
  WebGL-based software library for implementing projects, including an improved
  organization system for graphics code that has greatly benefited our
  students. To mitigate the difficulty of creating 3D graphics-enabled websites
  and online games, we furthermore introduce the “Encyclopedia of Code”—a
  World Wide Web framework that encourages visitors to learn 3D computer
  graphics, build educational graphical demos and articles, host them online,
  and organize them by topic. Our own contributed examples include various
  interactive tutorials and educational games. Some of our modules expose
  students to new graphics techniques, while others explore new modes of online
  learning, collaboration, and computing. In comparison to earlier online
  graphics coding platforms and mainstream graphics educational materials, the
  resources that we have developed offer a significantly unique set of features
  for both inside and outside our classrooms.%

    {In many scenarios a dynamic scene is filmed by multiple video cameras
  located at different viewing positions. Visualizing such multi-view data on a
  single display raises an immediate question—which cameras capture better
  views of the scene? Typically, (e.g. in TV broadcasts) a human producer
  manually selects the best view. In this paper we wish to automate this
  process by evaluating the quality of a view, captured by every single camera.
  We regard human actions as three-dimensional shapes induced by their
  silhouettes in the space-time volume. The quality of a view is then evaluated
  based on features of the space-time shape, which correspond with limb
  visibility. Resting on these features, two view quality approaches are
  proposed. One is generic while the other can be trained to fit any preferred
  action recognition method. Our experiments show that the proposed view
  selection provide intuitive results which match common conventions. We
  further show that it improves action recognition results.}%

    {Research has shown imagery interventions to be important tools for
  learning new skills, as well as enhancing competitive performance. Moreover,
  imagery vividness and ability are two factors shown to contribute to their
  effectiveness. Therefore, learning ways to increase one's imagery vividness
  and ability is important. Hence, the present research examined the effects of
  an external stimulus (i.e., a self-modeling video) on one's imagery vividness
  and ability. A self-modeling video is an edited video showing the desired
  target behaviors; in this case it was a competitive dive. Two imagery
  measures (VMIQ and MIQ-R) were used to capture whether the self-modeling
  video would influence competitive divers' imagery vividness and ability.
  Seven competitive divers were administered both imagery measures at pre-test
  and post-test. After pre-test scores were taken, the participants' individual
  self-modeling videos were shown on three occasions before each competition
  and once at each competition. The results for the VMIQ indicated that imagery
  vividness when imaging the self was significantly better than when imaging
  others, F(1,6) = 7.44, p < 0.05, ?2 = .54. Of more importance is that the
  participants' imagery vividness increased after the self-modeling video had
  been administered for imaging one self but not for imaging others, although
  this only approached significance, F(1,6) = 3.70, p = .107, ?2 = .38. No
  significant results, however, were found for imagery ability. These findings
  suggest that there is potential for a self-modeling video to positively
  influence an athletes' imagery vividness.}%

    {Augmented reality (AR) is already part of the lives of thousands of
  people, in many different sectors. In addition to a change in current
  business models, the introduction of this technology in sports can greatly
  implement and improve fan engagement strategies and the fan experience in the
  world of e-sports. This research, starting from a concise but systematic
  literature review, analyses how mixed and augmented reality are providing a
  growing number of applications in the world of sport. Augmented reality is a
  technology that allows having a better perception of reality. This can help
  drive a vehicle, see obstacles that would otherwise not be noticed. Given
  that the nature of augmented reality makes it perfect for a dynamic sector
  such as sports, many applications can be identified in the sports field,
  however, many benefits can be identified: a) training for professionals and
  amateurs; b) marketing strategies and revenue diversifications for sports
  clubs; c) supporters’ experience; d) supporters’ engagement; e) valid and
  feasible alternative during pandemic outbreaks; f) measurement of sports
  results and sports assessment. Augmented reality has been introduced in the
  sports sector for a while. Many sports are exploiting the features of this
  new technology, by introducing apps for augmented reality that allow fans to
  get even closer to their beloved sport heroes. Cycling, football, fitness,
  cricket, winter sports many others, Apps to increase reality are developed in
  many different contexts, to experience a race, a match or simply to train
  with greater awareness, thus obtaining better results.}%

    {Recent advancements in Virtual Reality (VR) immersive technologies provide
  new tools for the development of novel and promising applications for
  neurological rehabilitation. The purpose of this paper is to review the
  emerging VR applications developed for the evaluation and treatment of
  patients with neurological diseases. We start by discussing the impact of
  novel VR tasks that encourage and facilitate the patient's empowerment and
  involvement in the rehabilitation process. Then, a systematic review was
  carried out on six well-known electronic libraries using the terms:
  â€œVirtual Reality AND Neurorehabilitation,â€ or â€œHead Mounted
  Display AND Neurorehabilitation.â€ This review focused on
  fully-immersive VR systems for which 12 relevant studies published in the
  time span of the last five years (from 2014 to 2019) were identified.
  Overall, this review paper examined the use of VR in certain neurological
  conditions such as dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, and
  multiple sclerosis. Most of the studies reveal positive results suggesting
  that VR is a feasible and effective tool in the treatment of neurological
  disorders. In addition, the finding of this systematic literature review
  suggested that low-cost, immersive VR technologies can prove to be effective
  for clinical rehabilitation in healthcare, and home-based setting with
  practical implications and uses. The development of VR technologies in recent
  years has resulted in more accessible and affordable solutions that can still
  provide promising results. Concluding, VR and interactive devices resulted in
  the development of holistic, portable, accessible, and usable systems for
  certain neurological disease interventions. It is expected that emerging VR
  technologies and tools will further facilitate the development of state of
  the art applications in the future, exerting a significant impact on the
  wellbeing of the patient.}%

    {Effective real-time feedback is crucial to enhance motor learning in
  physical and cognitive rehabilitation. Although monitor-based (MB) platforms
  are widely used to provide visual feedback for users, the discrepancy between
  where the feedback is presented and where the actual movement occurs can
  negatively affect the use of feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel
  visual feedback system using projection-based augmented reality (AR) to
  provide a better understanding of the relationship between body perception
  and movement kinematics. A set of experiments were performed to assess and
  compare the ability of unimpaired and impaired participants to detect
  real-time feedback and make modifications to gait using this feedback inMB
  and AR platforms. The results showed a significant improvement in
  participants ability to better adapt the changes in projection-based AR
  thanMB. This improvement represents the efficacy of this system in enabling
  users to better synchronize their footeye coordination.}%

    Publisher Summary This chapter discusses cognitive processes and learner
  strategies, and their involvement in the learning and performance of motor
  skills. The term motor skills have usually been with the physical, and in an
  athletic or recreational context. Yet, motor behaviors—also referred to as
  psychomotor or movement-oriented behaviors—permeate a wide variety of
  occupational and daily-living activities. At present, cognitive processes
  operate sequentially and serially to help produce skilled
  movement-performance. Some of them change in relative importance as skill is
  acquired. As the role of cognitive processes in the learning of various
  categories of tasks becomes revealed, the alternative and best strategies to
  enhance the operation of these processes can also be investigated and
  determined. Cognitive strategies represent, according to Gagné, one of five
  principal categories of learning outcomes; he further, distinguished motor
  skills from cognitive strategies. Subsequently, many strategies related to
  the learning of cognitive materials are similar to those involved in the
  mastery of motor skills. In addition, cognitions and strategies unique to
  psychomotor behaviors can be identified. It is noteworthy that current
  directions in cognitive psychology contrast traditional behavioristic
  thinking as to the active role learners play in expectations, perceptions,
  decision-making, interpreting feedback, making attributions to performance,
  arousal, memory and retrieval, and other processes. Taken together, the next
  step would seem to be a thorough analysis of the cognitive aspects of motor
  skill learning, with implications for learner strategies and training
  programs.%

  and internal–external rotation (IE) angles. However, previous studies have
  not considered PCA for exercises involving knee flexion angles that are
  greater than those typically experienced during gait. Thus, the goal of this
  study was to investigate using PCA to correct for crosstalk during one
  exercise (i.e., cycling) that involves relatively high flexion angles.
  Fifteen participants were tested in gait and cycling using a motion analysis
  system. Uncorrected FE, AA and IE angles were compared to those calculated
  with PCA performed on (1) all angles (FE-AA-IE PCA correction) and (2) only
  FE-AA angles (FE-AA PCA correction). Significant differences existed between
  uncorrected and FE-AA-IE PCA corrected AA and IE angles for both exercises,
  between uncorrected and FE-AA PCA corrected AA angles for both exercises, and
  between FE-AA-IE and FE-AA PCA corrected IE angles for cycling. Correlations
  existed before PCA correction and were eliminated following PCA correction
  with the exception that FE-IE correlations remained following FE-AA PCA
  correction. Since the two PCA analyses differed only in their IE angle
  predictions for the high flexion exercise (cycling), IE angle results were
  compared to previous studies. Using FE-AA PCA correction may be the preferred
  protocol for cycling as it appeared to retain physiological IE angle
  correlations at high flexion angles. However, there exists a critical need
  for studies aimed at obtaining more accurate IE angles in such exercises.%

    {Experimental life sciences like biology or chemistry have seen in the
  recent decades an explosion of the data available from experiments.
  Laboratory instruments become more and more complex and report hundreds or
  thousands measurements for a single experiment and therefore the statistical
  methods face challenging tasks when dealing with such high‐dimensional
  data. However, much of the data is highly redundant and can be efficiently
  brought down to a much smaller number of variables without a significant loss
  of information. The mathematical procedures making possible this reduction
  are called dimensionality reduction techniques; they have widely been
  developed by fields like Statistics or Machine Learning, and are currently a
  hot research topic. In this review we categorize the plethora of dimension
  reduction techniques available and give the mathematical insight behind
  them.}%

    What is Mixed Reality (MR)? To revisit this question given the many recent
  developments, we conducted interviews with ten AR/VR experts from academia
  and industry, as well as a literature survey of 68 papers. We find that,
  while there are prominent examples, there is no universally agreed on,
  one-size-fits-all definition of MR. Rather, we identified six partially
  competing notions from the literature and experts' responses. We then started
  to isolate the different aspects of reality relevant for MR experiences,
  going beyond the primarily visual notions and extending to audio, motion,
  haptics, taste, and smell. We distill our findings into a conceptual
  framework with seven dimensions to characterize MR applications in terms of
  the number of environments, number of users, level of immersion, level of
  virtuality, degree of interaction, input, and output. Our goal with this
  paper is to support classification and discussion of MR applications' design
  and provide a better means to researchers to contextualize their work within
  the increasingly fragmented MR landscape.%

    The role of intrinsic and extrinsic information feedback in learning a new
  bimanual coordination pattern was investigated. The pattern required
  continuous flexion-extension movements of the upper limbs with a 90 ° phase
  offset. Separate groups practiced the task under one of the following visual
  feedback conditions: (a) blindfolded (reduced FB group), (b) with normal
  vision (normal FB group), or (c) with concurrent relative motion information
  (enhanced FB group). All groups were subjected to three different transfer
  test conditions at regular intervals during practice. These tests included
  reduced, normal vision, and enhanced vision conditions. Experiment 1 showed
  that the group receiving augmented information feedback about its relative
  motions in real-time produced the required coordination pattern more
  successfully than the remaining two groups, irrespective of the transfer
  conditions under which performance was evaluated. Experiment 2 replicated and
  extended the superiority of the enhanced feedback group during acquisition
  and retention. Experiment 3 demonstrated that successful transfer to various
  transfer test conditions was not a result of test-trial effects. Overall, the
  data suggest that the conditions that optimized performance of the
  coordination pattern during acquisition also optimized transfer performance.%

    {Physiotherapy patients exercising at home alone are at risk of re-injury
  since they do not have corrective guidance from a therapist. To explore
  solutions to this problem, we designed Physio@Home, a prototype that guides
  people through prerecorded physiotherapy exercises using real-time visual
  guides and multi-camera views. Our design addresses several aspects of
  corrective guidance, including: plane and range of movement, joint positions
  and angles, and extent of movement. We evaluated our design, com-paring how
  closely people could follow exercise movements under various feedback
  conditions. Participants were most accurate when using our visual guide and
  multi-views. We provide suggestions for exercise guidance systems drawn from
  qualitative findings on visual feedback complexity.}%

    {There has been renewed interest in the role of strategies in sensorimotor
  learning. The combination of new behavioral methods and computational methods
  has begun to unravel the interaction between processes related to strategic
  control and processes related to motor adaptation. These processes may
  operate on very different error signals. Strategy learning is sensitive to
  goal-based performance error. In contrast, adaptation is sensitive to
  prediction errors between the desired and actual consequences of a planned
  movement. The former guides what the desired movement should be, whereas the
  latter guides how to implement the desired movement. Whereas traditional
  approaches have favored serial models in which an initial strategy-based
  phase gives way to more automatized forms of control, it now seems that
  strategic and adaptive processes operate with considerable independence
  throughout learning, although the relative weight given the two processes
  will shift with changes in performance. As such, skill acquisition involves
  the synergistic engagement of strategic and adaptive processes.}%

    {Mirrors have been a core feature in ballet studios for over five hundred
  years. While physical mirrors provide real-time feedback, they do not inform
  dancers of their errors. Thus, technologies such as motion tracking have been
  used to augment what a physical mirror can provide. Current augmented
  mirrors, however, only implement one mode of communication, usually visual,
  and do not provide a holistic feedback to dancers that includes all the
  feedback elements commonly used in ballet classes. We conducted a
  mixed-method study with 16 novices and 16 expert dancers in which we compared
  two different modes of communication (visual and verbal), two different types
  of feedback (value and corrective) and two levels of guidance (mirror, or no
  mirror). Participants' ballet technique scores were evaluated by a remote
  teacher on eight ballet combinations (tendue, adagio, pirouette, saute, pli,
  degage, frappe and battement tendue). We report quantitative and qualitative
  results that show how the level of guidance, mode of communication, and type
  of feedback, needs to be tuned in different ways for novices and experts.}%

    {Many optical-see-through displays have a relatively narrow field of view.
  However, a limited field of view can constrain how information can be
  presented and searched through. To understand these constraints, we present a
  series of experiments that address the interrelationships between field of
  view, information density, and search performance. We do so by simulating
  various fields of view using two approaches: limiting the field of view
  presented on a Microsoft HoloLens optical-see-through head-worn display and
  dynamically changing the portion of a large tiled-display wall on which
  information is presented, for head-tracked users in both cases. Our results
  indicate a significant effect of information density and field of view on
  search performance, with potential search performance benefits of using a
  larger FOV between ca. 7-28\%. Furthermore, while grids guided visual search,
  they did not significantly affect performance.}%

    {Poor posture can result in loss of physical function, which is necessary
  to preserving independence in later life. Its decline is often the
  determining factor for loss of independence in the elderly. To avoid this, a
  system to correct poor posture in the elderly, designed for Kinect-based
  indoor applications, is proposed in this paper. Due to the importance of
  maintaining a healthy life style in senior citizens, the system has been
  integrated into a game which focuses on their physical stimulation. The game
  encourages users to perform physical activities while the posture correction
  system helps them to adopt proper posture. The system captures limb node data
  received from the Kinect sensor in order to detect posture variations in real
  time. The DTW algorithm compares the original posture with the current one to
  detect any deviation from the original correct position. The system was
  tested and achieved a successful detection percentage of 95.20\%.
  Experimental tests performed in a nursing home with different users show the
  effectiveness of the proposed solution.}%

    {Technologies targeting a correct execution of physical training exercises

  which technology provides open-ended feedback for trainers and trainees to
  use during training. With a personal trainer we designed the augmentation of
  18 strength training exercises with BodyLights: 3D printed wearable
  projecting lights that augment body movement and orientation. To study them,
  15 trainees at different skill levels trained three times with our personal
  trainer and BodyLights. Our findings show that BodyLights catered to a wide

    {Literature shows an increasing interest for the development of augmented
  reality (AR) applications in several fields, including rehabilitation.
  Current studies show the need for new rehabilitation tools for upper
  extremity, since traditional interventions are less effective than in other
  body regions. This review aims at: Studying to what extent AR applications
  are used in shoulder rehabilitation, examining wearable/non-wearable
  technologies employed, and investigating the evidence supporting AR
  effectiveness. Nine AR systems were identified and analyzed in terms of:
  Tracking methods, visualization technologies, integrated feedback,
  rehabilitation setting, and clinical evaluation. Our findings show that all
  these systems utilize vision-based registration, mainly with wearable
  marker-based tracking, and spatial displays. No system uses head-mounted
  displays, and only one system (11\%) integrates a wearable interface (for
  tactile feedback). Three systems (33\%) provide only visual feedback; 66\%
  present visual-audio feedback, and only 33\% of these provide visual-audio
  feedback, 22\% visual-audio with biofeedback, and 11\% visual-audio with
  haptic feedback. Moreover, several systems (44\%) are designed primarily for
  home settings. Three systems (33\%) have been successfully evaluated in
  clinical trials with more than 10 patients, showing advantages over
  traditional rehabilitation methods. Further clinical studies are needed to
  generalize the obtained findings, supporting the effectiveness of the AR
  applications.}%

    {Latency between a user's movement and visual feedback is inevitable in
  every Virtual Reality application, as signal transmission and processing take
  time. Unfortunately, a high end-to-end latency impairs perception and motor
  performance. While it is possible to reduce feedback delay to tens of
  milliseconds, these delays will never completely vanish. Currently, there is
  a gap in literature regarding the impact of feedback delays on perception and
  motor performance as well as on their interplay in virtual environments
  employing full-body avatars. With the present study at hand, we address this
  gap by performing a systematic investigation of different levels of delay
  across a variety of perceptual and motor tasks during full-body action inside
  a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. We presented participants with their
  virtual mirror image, which responded to their actions with feedback delays
  ranging from 45 to 350 ms. We measured the impact of these delays on motor
  performance, sense of agency, sense of body ownership and simultaneity
  perception by means of psychophysical procedures. Furthermore, we looked at
  interaction effects between these aspects to identify possible dependencies.
  The results show that motor performance and simultaneity perception are
  affected by latencies above 75 ms. Although sense of agency and body
  ownership only decline at a latency higher than 125 ms, and deteriorate for a
  latency greater than 300 ms, they do not break down completely even at the
  highest tested delay. Interestingly, participants perceptually infer the
  presence of delays more from their motor error in the task than from the
  actual level of delay. Whether or not participants notice a delay in a
  virtual environment might therefore depend on the motor task and their
  performance rather than on the actual delay.}%

    {Many art forms present visual content as a single image captured from a
  particular viewpoint. How to select a meaningful representative moment from
  an action performance is difficult, even for an experienced artist. Often, a
  well-picked image can tell a story properly. This is important for a range of
  narrative scenarios, such as journalists reporting breaking news, scholars
  presenting their research, or artists crafting artworks. We address the
  underlying structures and mechanisms of a pictorial narrative with a new
  concept, called the action snapshot, which automates the process of
  generating a meaningful snapshot (a single still image) from an input of
  scene sequences. The input of dynamic scenes could include several
  interactive characters who are fully animated. We propose a novel method
  based on information theory to quantitatively evaluate the information
  contained in a pose. Taking the selected top postures as input, a
  convolutional neural network is constructed and trained with the method of
  deep reinforcement learning to select a single viewpoint, which maximally
  conveys the information of the sequence. User studies are conducted to
  experimentally compare the computer-selected poses and viewpoints with those
  selected by human participants. The results show that the proposed method can
  assist the selection of the most informative snapshot effectively from
  animation-intensive scenarios.}%

    {In rock climbing, discussing climbing techniques with others to master a
  specific route and getting practical advice from more experienced climbers is
  an inherent part of the culture and tradition of the sport. Spatial
  information, such as the position of holds, as well as learning complex body
  postures plays a major role in this process. A typical problem that occurs
  during advising is an alignment effect when trying to picture
  orientation-specific knowledge, e.g. explaining how to perform a certain
  self-climbed move to others. We propose betaCube, a self-calibrating
  camera-projection unit that features 3D tracking and distortion-free
  projection. The system enables a life-sized video replay and climbing route
  creation using augmented reality. We contribute an interface for automatic
  setup of mobile distortion-free projection, blob detection for climbing
  holds, as well as an automatic method for extracting planar trackables from
  artificial climbing walls.}%

    This chapter begins by reviewing the many definitions of the term open
  educational resources and concludes by discussing challenges and
  opportunities for the approach. Open educational resources (OER) are
  educational materials either licensed under an open copyright license or in
  the public domain. Neither the term ``open educational resources'' nor the
  term ``open'' itself has an agreed upon definition in the literature.
  Research regarding open educational resources focuses on methods of producing
  OER, methods of sharing OER, and the benefits of OER. Significant issues
  relating to OER remain unresolved, including business model and discovery
  problems.%

    {Background: Systematic literature studies have become common in software
  engineering, and hence it is important to understand how to conduct them
  efficiently and reliably. Objective: This paper presents guidelines for
  conducting literature reviews using a snowballing approach, and they are
  illustrated and evaluated by replicating a published systematic literature
  review. Method: The guidelines are based on the experience from conducting
  several systematic literature reviews and experimenting with different
  approaches. Results: The guidelines for using snowballing as a way to search
  for relevant literature was successfully applied to a systematic literature
  review. Conclusions: It is concluded that using snowballing, as a first
  search strategy, may very well be a good alternative to the use of database
  searches.}%

    Although augmented reality (AR) has gained much research attention in
  recent years, the term AR was given different meanings by varying
  researchers. In this article, we first provide an overview of definitions,
  taxonomies, and technologies of AR. We argue that viewing AR as a concept
  rather than a type of technology would be more productive for educators,
  researchers, and designers. Then we identify certain features and affordances
  of AR systems and applications. Yet, these compelling features may not be
  unique to AR applications and can be found in other technological systems or
  learning environments (e.g., ubiquitous and mobile learning environments).
  The instructional approach adopted by an AR system and the alignment among
  technology design, instructional approach, and learning experiences may be
  more important. Thus, we classify three categories of instructional
  approaches that emphasize the “roles,” “tasks,” and “locations,”
  and discuss what and how different categories of AR approaches may help
  students learn. While AR offers new learning opportunities, it also creates
  new challenges for educators. We outline technological, pedagogical, learning
  issues related to the implementation of AR in education. For example,
  students in AR environments may be cognitively overloaded by the large amount
  of information they encounter, the multiple technological devices they are
  required to use, and the complex tasks they have to complete. This article
  provides possible solutions for some of the challenges and suggests topics
  and issues for future research.%

    {External self-image is often used as an effective tool to enhance dancing
  technique, choreography, creativity, and expression. The traditional tools of
  presenting external image, such as mirrors or videos, are limited in their
  mobility, perspective, and immediacy. To address the issue, we present
  OutsideMe, a vision-sync mixed reality system that enables dancers see their
  body movements as external observers through a head-mounted display (HMD)
  device. This system captures dancer's posture and blends it into scenes from
  the dancer's original field of view in an interactive frame rate. The dancers
  can observe themselves without distracting their presence identities. In this
  research, we develop four work modes for supporting dancer's training, and
  carry out a feasibility study and a user study. The feedbacks from the
  participants performing various dancing styles are analyzed and discussed.
  The preliminary experimental results support our design.}%

    {We investigate how Mixed Reality (MR) can be used to guide human body
  motions, such as in physiotherapy, dancing, or workout applications. While
  first MR prototypes have shown promising results, many dimensions of the
  design space behind such applications remain largely unexplored. To better
  understand this design space, we approach the topic from different angles by
  contributing three user studies. In particular, we take a closer look at the
  influence of the perspective, the characteristics of motions, and visual
  guidance on different user performance measures. Our results indicate that a
  first-person perspective performs best for all visible motions, whereas the
  type of visual instruction plays a minor role. From our results we compile a
  set of considerations that can guide future work on the design of
  instructions, evaluations, and the technical setup of MR motion guidance
  systems.}%
